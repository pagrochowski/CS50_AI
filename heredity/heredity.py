    Note FROM SELF: 
    Consider example:
    Finally, we consider Harry. Whatâ€™s the probability that Harry has 1 copy of the gene? There are two ways this can happen. Either he gets the gene from his mother and not his father, or he gets the gene from his father and not his mother. His mother Lily has 0 copies of the gene, so Harry will get the gene from his mother with probability 0.01 (this is PROBS["mutation"]), since the only way to get the gene from his mother is if it mutated; conversely, Harry will not get the gene from his mother with probability 0.99. His father James has 2 copies of the gene, so Harry will get the gene from his father with probability 0.99 (this is 1 - PROBS["mutation"]), but will get the gene from his mother with probability 0.01 (the chance of a mutation). Both of these cases can be added together to get 0.99 * 0.99 + 0.01 * 0.01 = 0.9802, the probability that Harry has 1 copy of the gene.
